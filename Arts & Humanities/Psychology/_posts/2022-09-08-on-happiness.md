Thinking about happiness is probably more difficult than experiencing happiness. 
And formulating and putting it into words is difficult still.

I do have a frame in mind which I will try to setup to begin with. 
And after that, see if I can establish how happiness be derived from it. 

### The frame

I think you can't be happy if you can't reconcile your wrong action from the right. So I think defining whether something is right or wrong, for you personally, whether you do it for the short term or the long term is what makes you happy. I think that the feeling of happiness for most people is defined that way. If you're feeling guilty. So, if someone has done a 'wrong' thing, they can only be happy if they can reconcile the fact and then kinda make it in their head that it is right. That's the premise. I think, this premise, by implication need to be buttressed by the study of what is right and wrong, i.e. ethical philosoply.

This is it! You have crossed the CV screening!

## Make Sure 

### to pay full attention to each question. 

EVERY - SINGLE - WORD. There are very few open ended questions in an interview so it is always possible to narrow down the scope of the answer. 'Tell us a bit about yourself', in the beginning of many interviews is as open as it gets and even this one is not necessarily a license to speak at length about your captaincy for your high school basketball team 10 years ago (unless you are applying for a basketball/sports analytics company). Almost every other question is more specific. 'Tell us about a time when you made a mistake on the job'. And if necessary, clarify

### to go in depth technology / skills - to demonstrate understanding of it 
In depth might mean technical knowledge in a technical interview, or 

### you hear yourself speak
Do you sound credible? Are you repeating yourself? Are you using terms such as 'like I said'. 

		### both interviewers are happy... but not at the same time 
In a technical interview there is usually more than 1.

## Don't Assume 

### you already know the role 

This is not to say you should not talk about what value you can bring to the role, especially when asked. But it's important to not assume. The organisation has its own tech stack, policies, visions as well as limitations. the vision of the role or what you can bring to the role. The interviewer(s) are trying to find out if you are fit for the role. 

### they have figured out your CV 

Let's be honest here! Have you looked at anybody's CV for more than a couple minutes other than your own? If you are color-coding or leaving similar clues in your CV, 

### questions will be related to the context that YOU have set up 

You may have done a good job of answering the 'Tell us a bit about yourself' question. Perhaps you have also catered it to the requirements of the role in question. 
		
### the interview is about them answering your questions 
		
Of course, you want to learn more about the organisation. Curiosity about the organisation is one of the best ways to signal you are genuinely interested in the role. However, 
	
## Clarify 
		
### how long the interview is going to be

### what the DELIVERABLES / would be DELIVERABLES are 

### each question if you have to but don't be defensive 

## Bear in mind 

### interviewers assumes you are well versed in your skills until they find out you are not
		
Once the CV screening is done, you are already past the stage where you establish the value of your skills. You are in this interview because the organisation feels the skills you mention in the CV might be useful for the role they are hiring for. 

### a question may be a larva question  branch
This is particularly important for interviewees who have a tendency to come up with elaborate answers. Consider a scenario where you have `git` as a skill in your CV. The interviewers asks, 'what is your experience with `git`?' and has a follow up question in mind, 'how would you merge conflict between an upstream repository and local master branch?'. The interviewer really wants to know the answer to the second question which provides information about the interviewee's techinical knowledge of the skill they are interested in. It may be tempting to answer the first question by: 

- taking the listeners through a journey of how you went about learning `git` 
- discussing how important `git` is for version controlling and documentation and collaborative work
- highlighting power of `git` is best realized by capitalising on GitHub Actions or its CI/CD capabilities
- bring up how  Microsoft has acquired `git` and this might have all sorts of positive and negative ramifications in the IT industry.

You mean well but by doing this, you are depriving yourself the opportunity to answer the second question and demonstrating your skills
		
### what an ideal data analyst, engineer or scientist role should do 
		
This field is diverse and requirements that fulfill the roles are changing everyday - and are different across organisations. It is still the interviewee's responsibility to demonstrate how a data expert can be useful in an organisation.

### there is nothing wrong with a confident 'I do not know the answer to that.'

This is because the alternative is worse. If the issue is imporant, there will be follow up questions. 

## Miscellaneous

### Make sure you are not lacking substance or depth 
### Make sure you are not too confident for what you were providing

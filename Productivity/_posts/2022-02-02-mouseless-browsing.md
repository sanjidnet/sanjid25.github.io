SUMMARY: 
[by increasing order of maturity and steepness of learning curve]

1. [Vimari for Safari](https://github.com/televator-apps/vimari) and [VimiumC for Firefox and Chrome](https://github.com/gdh1995/vimium-c) 
   - Stay in the comform of familiar browsers
   - Navigate around as in VIM 
   - Copy from browser by `\` (finding) text, going on `v` visual mode and `y` yanking selection
2. [Surfingkeys](https://github.com/brookhong/Surfingkeys) 
   - Same as #1 and:
   - Edit input fields like VIM
   - Control the browser and manipulate the contents of a page. 
3. [Qutebrowser](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser). A useful [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/Av8Sfaprcb4)
   - Now we're in a new browser altogether. 
   - Customizability is next level. Using python or bash scripting

Bonus
Take it to the command line interface altogether using [W3M](https://wiki.debian.org/w3m). 
Cons: 
    - does not support javascript

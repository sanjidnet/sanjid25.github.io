* Predicting Lifetime Value (LTV)
    * what for: if you can predict the characteristics of high LTV customers, this supports customer segmentation, identifies upsell opportunties and supports other marketing initiatives
    * usage: can be both an online algorithm and a static report showing the characteristics of high LTV customers

* Wallet share estimation
    * working out the proportion of a customer's spend in a category accrues to a company allows that company to identify upsell and cross-sell opportunities
    * usage: can be both an online algorithm and a static report showing the characteristics of low wallet share customers

* Churn
    * working out the characteristics of churners allows a company to product adjustments and an online algorithm allows them to reach out to churners
    * usage: can be both an online algorithm and a statistic report showing the characteristics of likely churners

* Customer segmentation
    * If you can understand qualitatively different customer groups, then we can give them different treatments (perhaps even by different groups in the company). Answers questions like: what makes people buy, stop buying etc
    * usage: static report

* Product mix
    * What mix of products offers the lowest churn? eg. Giving a combined policy discount for home + auto = low churn
    * usage: online algorithm and static report

* Cross selling/Recommendation algorithms/
    * Given a customer's past browsing history, purchase history and other characteristics, what are they likely to want to purchase in the future?
    * usage: online algorithm

* Up selling 
    * Given a customer's characteristics, what is the likelihood that they'll upgrade in the future?
    * usage: online algorithm and static report

* Channel optimization 
    * what is the optimal way to reach a customer with certain characteristics?
    * usage: online algorithm and static report

* Discount targeting
    * What is the probability of inducing the desired behavior with a discount
    * usage: online algorithm and static report

* Reactivation likelihood
    * What is the reactivation likelihood for a given customer
    * usage: online algorithm and static report

* Adwords optimization and ad buying
    * calculating the right price for different keywords/ad slots

For each type of analysis think about:

* What problem does it solve, and for whom?
* How is it being solved today?
* How can it beneficially affect business?
* What are the data inputs and where do they come from?
* What are the outputs and how are they consumed- (online algorithm, a static report, etc)
* Is this a revenue leakage ("saves us money") or a revenue growth ("makes us money") problem?
